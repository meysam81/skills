# SEO Blog Post Review & Audit

Score a blog post draft against a 100-point SEO rubric. Identifies specific issues per category and provides actionable fix recommendations.

## References

Read these for evaluation criteria (relative to this skill's base directory):

- `../../references/on-page-seo-checklist.md`
- `../../references/eeat-signals.md`
- `../../references/schema-markup-templates.md`

## Inputs

1. **Draft** — `docs/seo/<slug>/draft.md` (required)
2. **Outline** — `docs/seo/<slug>/outline.md` (required — used to verify structure compliance)
3. **Keyword data** — `docs/seo/<slug>/keyword-data.md` (required — used to verify keyword usage)
4. **Article directory** — user specifies `docs/seo/<slug>/` or skill finds the directory containing `draft.md`

## Article Directory Convention

All per-article files live in `docs/seo/<slug>/`. The user provides the slug, or the skill finds it by looking for the directory containing `draft.md`.

## Process

### Step 1 — Read All Inputs

Read draft, outline, and keyword data files.

### Step 2 — Score Each Category

Evaluate every check in the rubric. For each:

- **Pass**: Award full points
- **Partial**: Award half points, note what's missing
- **Fail**: Award 0 points, provide specific fix

### Step 3 — Generate Report

## Output Format

Present the review directly in the conversation (do NOT write to a file):

```markdown
# SEO Review: {{Post Title}}

## Score: {{N}}/100 — {{PASS ✅ / NEEDS WORK ⚠️ / FAIL ❌}}

(Pass = 80+, Needs Work = 60-79, Fail = <60)

## Strengths

- {{What the draft does well — be specific}}
- {{Another strength}}

## Verdict

{{If score >= 80}}: Ready to publish. Apply the minor fixes above for a perfect score.
{{If score 60-79}}: Needs revision. Apply the fixes above and re-run `/seo-review`.
{{If score < 60}}: Significant rework needed. Consider re-running `/seo-write` with updated outline.
```

## Evaluation Guidelines

**Be strict but fair:**

- Don't penalize style choices that are valid but different from your preference
- DO penalize missing SEO fundamentals (keyword placement, heading structure)
- Award partial credit generously when the intent is right but execution is imperfect
- Quote specific text from the draft when noting issues (makes fixes actionable)

**Common issues to watch for:**

- Keyword stuffing (density > 2%)
- Wall-of-text paragraphs (> 4 sentences)
- Missing H2 ↔ secondary keyword mappings
- FAQ answers that are too long (> 80 words) or too short (< 30 words)
- Generic E-E-A-T signals ("experts say...") without specific attribution
- Broken heading hierarchy (H1 → H3 without H2)
- Filler introductions that delay value delivery

## User Action

After the review, tell the user:

> If score >= 80: "The draft is ready. Apply the minor fixes noted above, then publish or run `/seo-optimize` after publishing to verify on-page performance."
> If score < 80: "Apply the fixes above, then re-run `/seo-review <slug>` to check your score. Alternatively, re-run `/seo-write <slug>` if major structural changes are needed."

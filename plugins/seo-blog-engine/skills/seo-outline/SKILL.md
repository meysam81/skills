# SEO Content Outline Generator

Create a comprehensive, SEO-optimized content outline from research data and keyword analysis. The outline becomes the blueprint for the `seo-write` skill.

## References

Read these before generating the outline (relative to this skill's base directory):

- `../../references/on-page-seo-checklist.md`
- `../../references/eeat-signals.md`
- `../../references/schema-markup-templates.md`

## Inputs

The first three are required. If any is missing, tell the user which file to create first.

1. **Research brief** — `docs/seo/<slug>/research-brief.md` (from `seo-research` → Claude.ai)
2. **Keyword data** — `docs/seo/<slug>/keyword-data.md` (from `seo-keywords`)
3. **Brand voice** — `docs/seo/brand-voice.md`
4. **Topical clusters** — `docs/seo/topical-clusters.md` (if exists) — use to plan internal links to sibling posts in the same pillar and cross-pillar links
5. **Article directory** — user specifies `docs/seo/<slug>/` or skill looks for the most recent article directory with both `research-brief.md` and `keyword-data.md`

## Article Directory Convention

All per-article files live in `docs/seo/<slug>/`. The user provides the slug, or the skill finds it by looking for the directory containing the required input files.

## Process

### Step 1 — Read & Synthesize Inputs

Read all three files. Extract:

- Primary keyword, secondary keywords, LSI terms (from keyword data)
- Top competitor heading structures and word counts (from keyword data)
- Key facts, statistics, expert quotes (from research brief)
- Content gaps identified (from keyword data + research)
- Brand tone, terminology, ICPs (from brand voice)
- SERP features to target (featured snippet, PAA, etc.)

### Step 2 — Determine Content Strategy

Based on competitor analysis and keyword intent:

**Content type** (pick one):

- **Comprehensive guide**: Intent is broad informational, competitors average 2000+ words
- **How-to tutorial**: Intent includes "how to", step-by-step format needed
- **List post**: Keyword suggests enumeration ("best", "top", "types of")
- **Comparison**: Keywords include "vs", "alternative", "comparison"
- **Definition/explainer**: Simple informational, competitors average < 1500 words

**Target word count**: Beat the median of top 5 competitors by 20-30%, capped at reasonable length. Don't pad for length.

### Step 3 — Build the Outline

Generate a complete outline with every element specified.

## Output

Write to `docs/seo/<slug>/outline.md`:

```markdown
# Content Outline: {{Topic}}

**Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
**Content type**: {{Comprehensive guide / How-to / List / Comparison / Explainer}}

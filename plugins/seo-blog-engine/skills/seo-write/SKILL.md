# SEO Blog Post Writer

Write a complete, publish-ready blog post from an approved outline. The draft follows the outline exactly, integrates research data, matches brand voice, and meets all on-page SEO requirements.

## References

Read these before writing (relative to this skill's base directory):

- `../../references/on-page-seo-checklist.md`
- `../../references/eeat-signals.md`
- `../../references/schema-markup-templates.md`

## Inputs

ALL three are required:

1. **Approved outline** — `docs/seo/outline.md` (from `seo-outline`, user-reviewed)
2. **Research brief** — `docs/seo/research-brief.md`
3. **Brand voice** — `docs/seo/brand-voice.md`

## Process

### Step 1 — Internalize All Inputs

Read all three files completely. Before writing, confirm understanding of:

- Brand tone and terminology (from brand voice)
- Heading structure and word count targets (from outline)
- Key facts, stats, quotes to integrate (from research brief)
- Keyword distribution plan (from outline)
- E-E-A-T signals to embed (from outline)

### Step 2 — Write the Full Draft

Write the complete post in one pass, following the outline structure exactly.

**Writing rules:**

**Keyword optimization:**

- Primary keyword in first 100 words (naturally, not forced)
- Primary keyword in H1 (from outline)
- Primary keyword in conclusion paragraph
- Secondary keywords in their assigned H2 headings
- LSI terms distributed naturally throughout body
- Keyword density: 1-2% maximum — if it reads awkwardly, reduce
- Never bold or italicize keywords just for SEO

**Structure:**

- Follow outline heading hierarchy exactly (H1, H2, H3)
- Hit word count targets per section (±10% is acceptable)
- Short paragraphs: 2-4 sentences maximum
- Use varied formatting: bullets, numbered lists, bold key terms, tables
- Transition sentences between every section
- One idea per paragraph

**E-E-A-T signals:**

- Integrate experience examples where the outline specifies
- Cite sources inline: "According to [Source] (Year)..." or "[Stat] ([Source])"
- Include methodology/reasoning behind recommendations
- Author perspective: use "we" for organizational experience, specific examples

**FAQ section:**

- Write answers in snippet-optimized format
- Lead with direct answer (first sentence answers the question completely)
- Expand with 1-2 supporting sentences
- Target 40-60 words per answer
- Match question text exactly to H3 headings

**Links:**

- Internal links at first natural mention of related topic
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here" or "read more")
- External links to authoritative sources as specified in outline
- Every factual claim backed by research brief citation

**Images:**

- Where outline specifies images, write descriptive alt text suggestions
- Format: `![Alt text description](image-placeholder.webp)`
- Include caption suggestions where helpful

**Tone:**

- Match brand voice document exactly
- Human, not robotic — vary sentence length and structure
- Conversational where appropriate, technical where needed
- No filler phrases ("In today's world...", "It goes without saying...")
- No generic introductions — start with the hook specified in outline

### Step 3 — Generate Schema Markup

Based on the outline's schema plan, generate complete JSON-LD blocks using the templates from `schema-markup-templates.md`.

- Always include Article schema
- Always include BreadcrumbList schema
- Include FAQPage schema if FAQ section exists
- Include HowTo schema if tutorial format
- Use placeholder values that are easy to fill in: `{{AUTHOR_NAME}}`, `{{PUBLISH_DATE}}`, etc.

### Step 4 — Self-Review Checklist
